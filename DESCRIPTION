Description: Improved analysis of marine animal movement data by implementing 
    a state-space hidden Markov model (HMM) to improve position estimates. 
    Position estimates are derived by comparing electronic tag data (from tags
    deployed on marine animals, typically fish) to three-dimensional oceanographic
    data.
