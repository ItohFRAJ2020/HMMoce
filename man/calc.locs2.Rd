\usage{
calc.locs2(locs, iniloc, g, raster = TRUE, dateVec, errEll = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{errEll}{is logical indicating whether error ellipses should be 
generated for light-based likelihoods as given from output
of WC-GPE. False if only longitude should be used.}

\item{:}{locs is -Locations file output from DAP for WC tags and contains
GPS, Argos, and GPE locations as applicable}

\item{:}{iniloc is 2 x 5 dataframe containing day, month, year,
lat, lon for both tag and pop locations}

\item{:}{g is output from setup.grid and indicates extent and resolution
of grid used to calculate likelihoods}
}
\value{
: L is array of lon x lat likelihood surfaces (matrices)
         for each time point (3rd dimension)
}
