\title{Calculate Ocean Heat Content (OHC) probability surface}
\usage{
calc.ohc(pdt, ptt, isotherm = "", ohc.dir, dateVec, bathy = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pdt}{is variable containing tag-collected PDT data}

\item{isotherm}{default '' in which isotherm is calculated on the fly based 
on daily tag data. Otherwise, numeric isotherm constraint can be specified 
(e.g. 20 deg C).}

\item{ohc.dir}{local directory where get.hycom downloads are stored.}

\item{dateVec}{is vector of dates from tag to pop-up in 1 day increments.}
}
\value{
likelihood is raster brick of likelihood surfaces representing 
  estimated position based on tag-based OHC compared to calculated OHC using 
  HYCOM
}
\description{
Compare tag data to OHC map and calculate likelihoods
}
