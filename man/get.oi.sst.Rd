downloaded to that file. Otherwise the data is not downloaded.}

\item{download.file}{Should use the default download.file function to query 
the server and download or use the optional curl function. Some users may
need to use curl in order to get this to work.}

\item{vars}{A list of variables to download. This should only contain
'sst' 'anom' 'err' but is not checked for errors}

\item{include_latlon}{Should the array of latitude and longitude values be
included?}

\item{:}{dir is directory where nc files should be downloaded to. default is
current working directory. if enter a directory that doesn't exist, it will
be created.}

service.

\description{
The method may return before the download is completed. It will continue
to display progress  until the download completes.
}
\details{
Ideally download.file (default method) would be used instead of curl (optional), but this does not 
seem to work on some platforms.
