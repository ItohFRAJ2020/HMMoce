\usage{
calc.ohc(pdt, isotherm = "", ohc.dir, g, dateVec, raster = "stack",
  downsample = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{:}{pdt is variable containing tag-collected PDT data}

\item{:}{isotherm is default '' in which isotherm is calculated
on the fly based on daily tag data. Otherwise, numeric isotherm
constraint can be specified (e.g. 20).}

\item{:}{ohc.dir is local directory where get.hycom downloads are
stored.}
}
\value{
: likelihood is array of likelihood surfaces representing
matches between tag-based ohc and hycom ohc maps
}
